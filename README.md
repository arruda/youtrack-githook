GitLab Hook for YouTrack
========================

This project provides a small HTTP endpoint to process the payload of a webhook
sent by GitLab.

It creates a comment in each referenced issue mentioning the author, the commit
message, and a link to the commit page in GitLab.


Configuration

TBD

See `settings.cfg`.


Deployment
----------

TBD

    GITHOOK_SETTINGS=settings.cfg python githook.py

Also see [Deployment Options](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/) for Flask.


Development Environment
-----------------------

This project is using Flask and the YouTrack REST Python Library, both of which
still depend on Python 2.x.

The easiest way to start developing is using virtualenv:

    virtualenv -p python2 VENV
    . VENV/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
